   enable_ssl_encryption

   access_control_list
      Access control list (ACL) for web client connections. ACL is a 
      comma separated list of IP subnets, each subnet is prepended by 
      '-' or '+' sign. Plus means allow, minus means deny. If subnet mask 
      is omitted, like "-1.2.3.4", then it means single IP address. 
      Mask may vary from 0 to 32 inclusive. On each request, full list is 
      traversed, and last match wins. Default: if not set, ALLOW ALL.

      Example: -0.0.0.0/0,+192.168.0.0/24
      Deny connections from everywhere, allow only all IP addresses from
      subnet 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0 to connect.

      Must match value in SPC EDP communication settings.

   spc_id
      SPC EDP Panel ID. A number which will be used by the SPC Web Gateway to 
      identify the SPC panel. Must match value in SPC EDP communications 
      settings.

   gateway_id
      SPC Gateway ID. A number which will be used by the SPC panel to 
      identify the SPC Web Gateway as a EDP receiver. Must match value in 
      SPC EDP Receiver settings.
   
   spc_time_diff
      How many hours the normal time differs between the SPC panel and the
      SPC Web Gateway system. Set to 0 if both systems have same time setting.
      Example: If SPC Panel has local Swedish time (CET) and the 
      SPC Web Gateway system has Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) the value should
      be +1.
